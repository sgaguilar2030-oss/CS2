# Advanced Grade Calculator suited for Pisay Scholars

 ## Project Description
  This advanced calculator is a python program that helps students calculate their final grade based on formative and summative test scores. It also includes showing the GWA table and indicate if you passed or failed. This code applies basin programming concepts learned in the first quarter, including variables, conditionals, loops, and functions, and concepts in the second quarter like functions and libraries.

## Features
1. Input amount of subjects to calculate
2. Input name for the first subject
3. Input the weight and grades of the formative and alternative assessments (in percentage)
4. Enter the weight and grades for midterm and final examination (if any)
5. Repeat for all other subjects
6. Compute and calculate the GWA based of given percentages and scores
7. Display GWA percentage
8. Display GWA table
9. Indicates if you passed or failed
10. Asks user whether they want to loop or not

## How to run the code
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Download the 'advanced_grade_calculator.py' file
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the program by pressing F5 or clicking 'Run' 
5. Follow the instructions for all inputs

## Example Output
Reminder: Please use percentage form! This is very crucial to this program1
Enter the amount of subjects you will be calculating: 1

Subject #1
Enter subject name: Math

Formative assessments
Enter how many formative assessments you took: 1
Enter the weight of the formative assessment to your final GWA: 30
Enter grade for formative assessment #1: 100

Alternative assessments
Enter how many alternative assessments you took: 2
Enter the weight of the alternative assessment to your final GWA: 25
Enter grade for alternative assessment #1: 95
Enter grade for alternative assessment #2: 100
Did you take a midterm examination? (1 = yes, 2 = no): 2
Did you take a final examination? (1 = yes, 2 = no): 1
Did you take a final examination? (1 = yes, 2 = no): 1
Enter the weight of the final exam to your final GWA: 45
Enter your score in the final exam: 91

Your GWA percentage for Math is: 95.33

Show GWA table? (1 = yes, 2 = no): 1

Below 55        3.00 or below  
------------------------------
Remember that the GWA table may have inaccuracies.
Would you like to loop? (1 = yes, 2 = no): 2

Thank you for using the GWA calculator! (｡･∀･)ﾉﾞ
