# Advanced Grade Calculator suited for Pisay Scholars

 ## Project Description
  This advanced calculator is a python program that helps students calculate their final grade based on formative and summative test scores. It also includes showing the GWA table and indicate if you passed or failed. This code applies basin programming concepts learned in the first quarter, including variables, conditionals, loops, and functions, and concepts in the second quarter like functions and libraries.

## Features
1. Input amount of subjects to calculate
2. Input name for the first subject
3. Input the weight and grades of the formative and alternative assessments (in percentage)
4. Enter the weight and grades for midterm and final examination (if any)
5. Repeat for all other subjects
6. Compute and calculate the GWA based of given percentages and scores
7. Display GWA percentage
8. Display GWA table
9. Indicates if you passed or failed

## How to run the code
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Download the 'advanced_grade_calculator.py' file
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the program by pressing F5 or clicking 'Run' 
5. Follow the instructions for all inputs
