# Advanced Grade Calculator suited for Pisay Scholars

 ## Project Description
  This advanced calculator is a python program that helps students calculate their final grade based on formative and summative test scores. It also includes other requirements for grades like attendance, participation, and oral recitations. This code applies basin programming concepts learned in the first quarter, including variables, conditionals, loops, and functions.

## Features
1. Input students name and scores for formative and summative assessments
2. Include inputs for attendance, participations, and oral recitation
3. Supports multiple subjects
4. Displays grades with two decimal places
5. Compute and calculate the final average based of given percentages and scores.

## How to run the code
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Download the 'advanced_grade_calculator.py' file
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the program by pressing F5 or clicking 'Run' 
5. Follow the instructions for name and score input

## Example Output
Reminder: Please use percentage form! This is very crucial to this program
Enter the amount of subjects you will be calculating: 1

Subject #1
Enter subject name: Mathematics 2

Formative assessments
Enter how many formative assessments you took: 1
Enter the weight of the formative assessment to your final GWA: 25
Enter grade for formative assessment #1: 100

Alternative assessments
Enter how many alternative assessments you took: 2
Enter the weight of the alternative assessment to your final GWA: 45
Enter grade for alternative assessment #1: 100
Enter grade for alternative assessment #2: 95
Did you take a midterm examination? (1 = yes, 2 = no): 2
Did you take a final examination? (1 = yes, 2 = no): 1
Enter the weight of the final exam to your final GWA: 30
Enter your score in the final exam: 95

Your GWA percentage for Mathematics 2 is: 97.38

Show GWA table? (1 = yes, 2 = no): 1
